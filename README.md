SalesTax
========

This is my first venture into programming java in response to the below coding challenge.  
This is a simple sales tax caluclator using regex to identify patterns from user input.   

I used this as an opportunity to not only learn java but also JUnit and as an exercise  
in making a simple application object oriented and extendable.

Write an application that prints out the receipt details for these shopping baskets.
